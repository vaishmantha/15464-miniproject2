15-464 Mini-project 2 

I did Option 1 and a bit of Option 3. 

proj3/ contains the code necessary to run the simulation. To view the result, simply open proj3.html. The .mov files inside the Google Drive folder are the clips used in the Report presentation. 

The skeleton for WebGL and JavaScript code was used from https://www.ics.uci.edu/~shz/courses/cs114/docs/proj3/index.html. The main code logic I wrote is located in proj3_sim.js.
